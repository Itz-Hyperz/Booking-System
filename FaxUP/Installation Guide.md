# Installation (Themes)
- Navigate to your site settings / theme management category on your website.
- Upload the theme CSS file to your website and save changes.
- If necessary, apply the theme in the site settings after you have uploaded the theme.
- Enjoy!

# Installation (Manual)
- Navigate to your website `views` folder.
- Open the `_header.ejs` file within the folder to begin editing it.
- Add the below line to the `_header.ejs` file **below** where it says `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/main.css" />`
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.hyperz.net/themes/hyperz-status.css" />
```
- Save your `_header.ejs` file now.
- Load your website, it may take awhile for your website cache to update and load the new CSS files and styling.
- If you wish to clear this up, you can get a CSS Reloader chrome extension to reload it manually. (link below)
